## Assignment ##

Create one of the carousels as shown on the design (the png file).

### Steps ###

1. Clone this repo.
2. The main instructions are specified in the attached design, make sure you read them!

### Plz also take into account ###

* Please spend three to max four hours on this assignment.
* Do not use any existing libraries to implement the slider (e.g jQuery). Implement it yourself :-).
* Your result does not have to be 100% the same.
* Make it responsive and asynchronous.
* What is important is the motivation of your choices: tell us why you implemented the carousel in a particular way. And for instance why your solution is better compared to another solutions (and off course explain why).

### Bonus ###
1. Bonus: if you add some testing.
2. Bonus: if you can create a second version without JavaScript.
